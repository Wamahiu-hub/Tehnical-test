<p2>In a report, the International Hydropower Association (IHA) said China’s newly installed capacity included over 6,200 GW of pumped storage capacity, in line with its goal to have as much as 80 GW of pumped storage capacity by 2027.</p2>

<p3>Installed hydropower capacity is expected to continue growing to meet the region’s electricity demand. It will also provide the region with electricity export opportunities,” the report read.

    <br><br>“Despite the existing large potential for new development, many policymakers have not included hydropower in their net-zero strategies. Fossil fuels still dominate the power systems of several countries within the region,” it added.
    After China, Laos installed the second largest capacity at 548 MW, followed by Cambodia with 459 MW, Vietnam with 334 MW, and Indonesia with 182 MW.

    <br>IHA also noted that several countries have projects in the pipeline, citing Indonesia which is developing the biggest hydropower project in the country, the Mentarang Induk hydropower plant, with a capacity of 1,375MW

    Indonesia also plans to resume the development of the 9,000 MW Kayan hydropower project in North Kalimantan..</p3>
